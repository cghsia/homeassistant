alias: Light Switch/Dimmer based on Axis Video Motion Detection 4 (Axis VMD4)
description: "This example uses Axis VMD4 on an Axis M3105 POE IP network camera as the primary trigger to run scripts to turn on outdoor front lights when motion is detected."
trigger:
  # If Axis VMD4 detects motion...
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.m3105_l_0_vmd4_camera1profileany

    value_template: "{{ state.attributes.elevation }}"
action:
  # Choose the following actions based on a time condition...
  - choose:
    # IF: Run this script before 9:00pm
      - conditions:
