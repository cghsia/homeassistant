## axis_vmd4_automation.yaml
Automation turning on lights based on motion detection using Axis Video Motion Detection 4 (VMD4) after sunset. This automation includes time-based conditional actions along with a random delay to keep lights on before turning off. The automation will auto-restart if VMD4 continually detects motion.
