Various Home Assistant automations I'm using or have used for sharing/collaborative documentation.

# File listing

## axis_vmd4_automation-group-of-actions.yaml
Automation turning on lights based on motion detection using Axis Video Motion Detection 4 (VMD4), turning on lights only if the sun is below the horizon (or after sunset but before sunrise)). This automation includes time-based conditional actions (group of actions) along with a random delay to keep lights on before turning off. The automation will auto-restart if VMD4 continually detects motion.

This automation is based off of the following HA documentation: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/#choose-a-group-of-actions

## node-red_axis_vmd4.json
More or less the same as axis_vmd4_automation-group-of-actions.yaml but done in Node-Red

## node-red_axis_vmd4-email-notification.json
More or less the same as node-red_axis_vmd4.json but with email notification along with picture attachment when Axis VMD4 detected motion. 

The original Node-Red flow (node-red_axis_vmd4.json) was updated to include email notifications as my Axis M3105-L somehow stopped sending emails whenever motion is detected. It still records video as expected, but the second event action to send emails results in an error in the camera's log.

Clean JSON without secrets/authentication information.
